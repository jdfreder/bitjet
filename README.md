Binary visualization using IPython widgets. This is a Jupyter/IPython notebook extension and in its current state, :warning: just an experiment :warning:.

Canvas + IPython widgets are so slick.

## Installation

This use IPython 3, which at the time of this writing only has a release candidate out. To install a new copy of IPython, upgrading over your old version run:

```console
pip install --pre ipython[all]
python setup.py
```

If you want to use all the examples, you'll need numpy.

```console
pip install numpy # Here be dragons
```

Should work in Python 2 and Python 3. This is an experiment.
