# Bitjet

Binary visualization using IPython widgets. This is a Jupyter/IPython notebook extension and in its current state just an experiment.

Canvas + IPython widgets are so slick.

Currently, this has to be installed using setup.py.

```
python setup.py install
```

For development, use

```
python setup.py develop
```

Should work in Python 2 and Python 3. This is an experiment.
